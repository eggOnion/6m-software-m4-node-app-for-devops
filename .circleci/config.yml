# workflows: simple_workflow  -> *the name of the workflow
# This workflow consists of two jobs: build and test. 
# The test job "requires" the build job to complete successfully before it can run. 
# This represents a basic CI/CD workflow where the application is built and tested.

# In summary, this CircleCI configuration defines a basic workflow for a Node.js application, involving 
# building and testing using Docker images. The success of the workflow depends on the successful completion 
# of the build job before the test job can run.
